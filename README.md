# Gaussian Process and Neural Network Integration

## Project Overview

This project explores the integration of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Neural Networks to efficiently predict hyperparameters for GPR models. By using synthetic datasets, the project demonstrates:

1. Generating datasets with custom characteristics.
2. Extracting meaningful features from data.
3. Training GPR models to derive hyperparameters.
4. Leveraging a neural network to predict hyperparameters, reducing computation time.
5. Visualizing data, model predictions, and performance metrics.

## Steps

### 1. Data Generation
- Synthetic datasets are created with customizable parameters such as amplitude, scale, and noise.
- **Visualization**: Example datasets are plotted to demonstrate variability.

### 2. Feature Computation
- Statistical features (e.g., range, variance, skewness) are calculated for each dataset.
- These features serve as inputs for the neural network.

### 3. GPR Training
- GPR models are trained on the datasets to derive hyperparameters like amplitude, length scale, and noise level.
- Extracted hyperparameters are used as target values for the neural network.

### 4. Neural Network Training
- A neural network is trained using dataset features as inputs and GPR hyperparameters as outputs.
- This approach significantly reduces the time needed for hyperparameter optimization in future predictions.

### 5. Visualization and Evaluation
- Multiple plots are generated, including:
  - Synthetic dataset samples.
  - Predicted vs. actual hyperparameters.
  - Performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).
